    <div class="container">
        <p>Hi Shradha/Aditya,</p>
        
        <p>Hope you guys are doing great. This is <span class="highlight">SIVA VARA PRASAD KAKARAPARTHI</span>. I gave my final interview for Planful in mid-November. You may not remember me since it’s been a while. We didn’t move forward as I was not comfortable with the sprint call scheduled from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM.</p>
        
        <h2>Why am I reaching out to you now:</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, I joined a service-based organization where I am a Tech Lead. This role is primarily focused on creating sprint stories, assigning tasks, estimating, and supporting the team. While I enjoy coding and learning new things, this role is quite the opposite of what I want at this stage. I do aspire to lead in the future, but maybe 2-3 years later.</p>
        
        <p>Since I had already cleared all interviews at Planful for the Senior Software Engineer position, I wanted to check if there is any possibility of joining. I had initially reached out to Aditya, but due to my notice period, I was told the company could not move forward. However, after rechecking, I found that I could exit my current project in approximately 4 weeks (max 45 days with a buffer). I may even be able to join earlier.</p>
        
        <h2>Why am I interested in Planful despite my initial concerns about sprint call timings:</h2>
        <p>During my initial discussion with the team, the call timing was highlighted because a Scrum Master from the PST timezone had joined. However, the Scrum Master may move to a different team, or I could be reassigned in the future. I have learned to manage this, and 1-2 hours of late calls are manageable for me.</p>
        <p>From my first interview round, I enjoyed interacting with the interviewers at Planful and learning what they liked about working there. The company has a great work-life balance, which is something I value for long-term growth. I also noticed that many engineers from Microsoft, Teradata, etc., have joined Planful, which speaks volumes about the work environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Will I back off after receiving the offer?</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">No way.</span> From the beginning, I have maintained the highest level of integrity. Even after clearing all the interviews, I had the option to use the offer to negotiate a counteroffer with my current employer, but I did not.</p>
        <p>In my previous organization, I was initially placed in a legacy project and decided to resign. However, they later offered to move me to a new project that I liked, but asked for a 2-year commitment. I stayed for 3 years. I believe it’s important to share this to demonstrate my commitment.</p>
        <p>Before joining my current organization, I had emailed Aditya expressing my interest in Planful and discussing the offer. However, I did not receive a response in time, and by the time I followed up, the position was still open, but I had already moved on. I have been following up with Aditya since the first week of January. If my notice period was the only concern, as mentioned, I can join within 45 days.</p>
        
        <h2>Why am I pursuing Planful?</h2>
        <p>Rather than preparing for another switch, which could take a year, I would rather focus on finding the right opportunity. Although I could switch for a 20-30% hike, that is not my primary motivation. I am looking for a company with a good work-life balance, surrounded by talented engineers with ample learning opportunities. Since Planful already meets these criteria, I wanted to give it one last try.</p>
        
        <h2>How about an in-person meeting at your company?</h2>
        <p>I would love to connect in person to provide a better understanding of my position and abilities, and to build trust.</p>
        
        <h2>What if the answer is NO?</h2>
        <p>While I would be disheartened, I understand that challenges are part of life. If that’s the case, I will take on my next challenge and move forward.</p>
        
        <p>Awaiting your response.</p>
        
        <p>Regards,<br><span class="highlight">Siva Vara Prasad KAKARAPARTHI</span></p>
